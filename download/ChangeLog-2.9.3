    Fix dimlevel percentage calculation bug
    
    The bug affected Heyu 'dimlevel', 'memlevel' and 'heyu_state' state
    commands output in case of appliance modules (ie. those not supporting
    any brightness manipulation signals) which were not considered standard
    X10 modules, having native full brightness level different from standard
    X10 level of 210.
    
    Since Heyu 'show dimlevels' administrative command algorithm was
    returning correct percentage values even for those non-standard
    appliance modules, simply reusing its calculation method while
    processing state commands should fix the problem.

    Stop using select() as a *sleep() replacement on linux
    
    It has been prooved that using select() as a replacement for a *sleep()
    while looping through the spool file monitoring functions c_engine() and
    c_monitor(), may cause a not yet clearly understood problem to occure
    when running on a relatively recent GNU/Linux platform, like Fedora 13.
    
    Don't define HASSELECT for linux any more.
    
    Created and tested against heyu-2.9.2.

    Fix sensorfault reported inactivity bit
    
    With post-2.8.0 changes, the sensorfail state command started giving
    results about sensors inactivity that seem not what one could expect.
    Fix it in a way that only sensors which follow the hearbeat concept
    are taken into account. Use stored individual sensor inactivity state
    bits, updated once a second, instead of recalculating it all again
    from timestamps.
    
    Applies on top of patch 1/2, 'Fix sensorfault tamper bit'.

    Fix sensorfault reported tamper bit
    
    The Heyu 'sensorfault' state command recalculates its tamper output bit
    from individual sensor's tamper state flags. Use the already maintained
    global tamper state flag for this instead. NB this changed behaviour is
    consistent with what the Heyu 'armedstate' state command returns, as
    well as with the Heyu launch conditions 'tamper' global flag and the
    '$X10_Tamper' environment variable which the Heyu engine launched
    scripts are provided with.

    No need to read x10state file from ore_emu
    
    Since the Heyu ore_emu command has been classified as a state command on
    its initial creation, it follows a standard pattern of a state command,
    starting from reading the Heyu x10state file. However, unlike regular
    state commands, it makes no use of the state data read in, only appends
    a synthesized signal to the Heyu spool file, which is then processed
    and reported by the Heyu engine. Thus, reading the x10state file can
    be omited, hopefully giving no nasty side effects.
    
    OTOH, this change should prevent the ore_emu command from failing
    occasionally with an "Unable to read state file." error message.
