    Engine: don't handle checksums when processing RF signals
    
    Commit 2cd54bdeb9, "Engine: use chksum_alert for all CM11 commands",
    introduced a mechanism for calculating checksums of all commands
    destined to a power line interface and passing them to the procedure
    that reads data back from that interface, in order to detect and ignore
    all checksum responses instead of reporting them as unknown values.
    However, that change didn't take into account that the code path which
    handled outgoing power line commands was also used for processing of
    X10 Standard RF signals obtained from an AUX interface even if not
    retransmitted over the power line. As a consequence, it may happen that
    an excessively stored checksum of an incoming RF signal will match an
    arbitrary byte of data read from the power line interface, resulting in
    temporary misinterpretation of the incoming data stream. Fix it.

    Attempt to fix Visonic support
    
    It looks like support for Visonic sensor signals received over a
    compatible RFXCOM interface, still implemented by Charles, may be in
    a more complete shape than it is exhibited in current Heyu releases,
    implemented only for a new, not yet used, dual receiver feature related
    code path. This patch simply updates the old code path, still active by
    default, to use the same Visonic processing pattern as the new one.
    
    Not tested, since I have neither Visonic sensors nor RFXCOM Visonic
    receiver available, and received no feedback from users so far. Applied
    in hope it will be verified as soon as the next release candidate is
    published.

    Enhance recognition of X10 Standard RF same signal bursts
    
    I've discovered an oddity in RFXCOM data processing which results in
    random X10 Standard RF signals happening to be reported more than once.
    After more thorough investigation I've found that single X10 Standard
    RF bursts can happen to be decoded and reported by the RFXCOM receiver
    working in default (variable length) mode in a slightly different way
    than other bursts of the same signal. This may be caused by noise, but
    I suspect this may also have something to do with new RFXCOM firmware,
    capable of decoding still more and more signal types, which may lead to
    less restrictive noise filtering.
    
    The contents of such distorted bursts is still correct, but they are
    reported to Heyu as being longer than others by 1 bit. While Heyu still
    recognises them as valid X10 Standard RF transmissions, comparing them
    with other bursts by their length fails, which results in reporting
    them as separate signals. If compared by their type and standard length
    contents instead, they no longer cause multi-burst series being broken
    into separate signals.
    
    I've implemented this fix for both current shared RFXCOM receive queue
    and a work in progress separate master/slave receive queues code paths.
    
    This patch replaces the reverted commit a65f3b9a1a0f.

    Prevent from checksums being incorrectly recognised as events

    Use a negative value for no checksum alert
    
    Originally used only for recognising 0x5a checksums from 0x5a poll
    requests, the chksum_alert variable initial value of 0 had been chosen
    as no checksum (0x5a) expected indication. However, since commit
    2cd54bdeb989c8f39ea6a96a6d2706bf88811ed5, "Engine: use chksum_alert for
    all CM11 commands", this is no longer true. The variable can happen to
    be filled with a legal checksum value of 0 as well, which could result
    in misinterpretation of the spool data stream and still end up with the
    infamous "Poll received unknown value ..." message.
    
    Since the chksum_alert is already declared as a signed integer, use
    a negative value for indicating no checksum expected instead of 0.

    Allow for precise dawn/dusk, night/notnight definition
    
    There was a Heyu configuration directive DAWNDUSK_DEF which allowed
    for selecting one of four fixed dawn/dusk definitions: Sunrise/Sunset,
    Civil Twilight, Nautical Twilight or Astronomical Twilight. Those were
    mapped directly into the dawn/dusk+-nn time specifiers used in the
    Heyu uploaded schedule timers, as well as the night/notnight global
    flags maintained by the Heyu engine and their derivative $X10_DawnTime,
    $X10_DuskTime and $X10_isNightTime environment variables.
    
    There was also an ISDARK_OFFSET configuration directive that allowed
    for specifying time offsets for another pair of the Heyu engine
    maintained global flags, dark/notdark, and their derivative
    $X10_isDarkTime environment variable, relative to the dawn/dusk times.
    
    Due to low resolution of the dawn/dusk possible selections, the
    DAWNDUSK_DEF configuration option was probably hardly used. Instead,
    users tended to place requests for another *_OFFSET option in order
    to have two actually usefull pairs of dark/notdark like global flags.
    
    With this patch applied, users should now be able to define their
    preferred dawn/dusk times very precisely, relative to the Sun position
    at their locations. The night/notnight pair of flags should then
    become more usefull, hopefully providing a replacement for a second
    dark/notdark.

    Cmd: Limit the wait for checksum timeout to 1 second
    
    In the current send_buffer() implementation, used for sending out powerline
    signals from a command line, the same timeout value of 10s, as forced by the
    calling functions, is used when waiting for both a checksum and READY
    response.
    
    It has been observed that a checksum response is either received immediatelly
    or not at all. Then, waiting for 10 seconds seems useless, and even harmfull
    since a heyu write lock is kept, preventing other commands from being run.
    
    The patch limits the wait for checksum timeout to 1 second, that seems way

    Cmd: Add distinct reporting of no checksum response
    
    In the current send_buffer() implementation, used for sending out powerline
    signals from a command line, if a wait for checksum timeout occures, it is not
    reported, even in verbose mode, other than incorrectly as a wrong checksum.
    This could effectively hide this potential source of other heyu problems,
    like "Unable to lock ..." events, from users and developers attention for
    years.
    
    This patch adds a distinct warning message in order to get users and
    developers attention to these rare, but harmful events. To not force users

    Cmd: don't hide checksums from the engine
    
    Using exread() for marking checksums to be recognized and ignored by the
    engine proved to be very error prone. Now that we have teached the engine to
    recognize checksums even if not marked, we can drop using this problematic
    function in favour of a simple xread(), that is free of similiar issues.
    
    This patch replaces exread() with xread() inside the send_buffer(), used by
    heyu commands, when reading checksums from the spool file.
    
    Initially created against heyu-2.3.0 and tested extensively since then. While
    corrected the core problem, it introduced a harmless side effect of
    dummy "Poll received unknown value ..." error messages acompanying every
    checksum.
    
    This version, refreshed against 2.9.0, applies and compiles on top of the
    former patch, Cmd: Avoid hiding a CM11 message got when awaiting 0x55,
    (http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/heyu_devel/message/4)
    
    Should work correctly, without the side effects mentioned, when used on top
    of the other 3 patches from this series.

    Engine: use correct checksum with CM11 upload
    
    The identify_sent() provided checksums are incorrect in case of CM11 upload
    commands.
    
    Since correct upload checksums are already calculated inside
    translate_other(), which is called from check4poll() for every upload command,
    we can obtain correct upload checksums by extending the translate_other()
    function API, as we already did to identify_sent() for use with other CM11
    commands.
    
    The patch implements this idea.

    Engine: use chksum_alert for all CM11 commands
    
    To prevent the engine from displaying the "Poll received unknown value ..."
    message when a raw checkum byte is read from the spool file, store a checksum
    calculated for a CM11 command in the chksum_alert variable, which is then used
    for matching expected checksum bytes. IOW, reuse the already implemented
    chksum_alert algorithm for matching all outgoing CM11 command checksums.

    Engine: provide check4poll() with checksums
    
    In order to teach the engine how to recognize checksum bytes related to
    outgoing CM11 commands, including powerline signals, found in the byte stream
    read from the spool file, the check4poll() function must get access to
    checksum values calculated for the relevant command sequences.
    
    This patch allows for this by modifying the API of the identify_sent()
    function, called by the check4poll(), adding a checksum, that is already
    computed inside the identify_sent() body, to the list of its returned
    variables.
    
    Created and briefly tested against heyu-2.9.0.

    Cmd: Avoid hiding a CM11 message got when awaiting 0x55
    
    Current send_buffer() routine, used by heyu command line for sending out
    powerline signals, tries to mark hidden all responses expected from the CM11
    during X10 signal submission, in order to prevent the heyu_engine from
    interpreting them as parts of incoming transmissions. There are two such
    responses expected: a checksum, and finally the READY byte (0x55).
    
    If it ever happens that an incomming signal is received during the send out
    procedure, a poll request byte (0x5a) can be received instead of the expected
    checksum or READY. Then, this 0x5a byte gets marked hidden instead of the
    expected one, effectively destroing full incoming powerline sequence (0x5a
    + the sequence) and preventing it from being recognized correctly by the
    heyu_engine. As a result, the incoming powerline signal gets lost, and the
    infamous "Poll received unknown value ..." message appears instead.
    
    This patch tries to correct the problem in case of incoming signal
    transmission received instead of expected READY. This can be done by simply
    not marking the expected 0x55 as hidden, since the engine is prepared for
    interpreting it correctly as a READY response. Then, any different byte
    received instead won't get marked as hidden as well and can be interpreted
    correctly by the engine.
    
    This is achieved by using xread(), that simply reads a response from the spool
    file, instead of the exread(), that starts with putting a "hidden" mark into
    the spool file, then calls xread().
    
    Unfortunatelly, this simple solution can't be used for correcting the problem
    in case of an incomming transmission received instead of checksum (actually,
    I have been using this method for several months, accepting false "Poll
    received unknown value ..." messages appearing in my log for every correct
    checksum received). An alternative solution has to be worked out.
    
    Initially created against heyu-2.3.0 and tested extensively since then. The
    herewith submitted version has been refreshed against heyu-2.9.0.

    Relay: Prevent incoming powerline signals from being destroyed by other signals
    
    In its current form, the heyu_relay puts an incomming poll request (0x5a) byte
    and a following signal(s) byte sequence into the spool file in two separate
    write() calls. Since this procedure doesn't respect spool file locks, it may
    happen that another signal, whether a command line, heyu_aux or whatever its
    source can be, gets inserted into the spool file inbetween, effectivelly
    destroying the full byte sequence required by the heyu_engine to actually
    recognize an incomming signal(s) sequence. This results in powerline signals
    happening to get lost, with the infamous "Poll received unknown value ..."
    error message being displayed.
    
    This patch tries to correct the problem by first collecting the whole
    sequence, consisting of one poll request (0x5a) byte and a subsequent
    incomming command(s) bytes, and then putting it into the spool file with one
    atomic write() call.
    
    I have initially created this patch against heyu-2.3.0 and tested extensively
    since then. The below version is refershed against current official release
    (2.9.0).
