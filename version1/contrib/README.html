These programs, scripts and files have been contributed by various people 
over  the last 5 years.  Some have been barely tested.  Use at your own
risk.

Future contributions will have a readme file as well as the program or text
files.


I'll try to get submissions installed here within 24 hours of receipt.


Sincerely,

Dan Suthers
