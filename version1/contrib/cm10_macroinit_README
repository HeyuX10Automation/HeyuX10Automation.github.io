This program is used only with the CM10A module.  The CM10A is like the
CM11A except for the fact that it has no eeprom (memory) nor any batteries.
The CM10A is was mostly sold with the original IBM Home Director packages.

It does have a very small macro capability, providing 42 bytes of storage.
This memory is cleared every time it's unplugged from the wall.

The reason the CM10A does not work with HEYU is that the CM10A requires
that it's macros be set when it's first powered on.  Unfortunately, it
starts up sending the byte 0xa5 every second, just like the CM11A does.

This program simply creates the proper byte stream to initialize the macro
memory to zeros.  See section 5.3 in the protocol.txt document for the
byte ordering in the data stream.

Use:  start by compiling the program, then run the program with the
output redirected to the CM10A's serial port.

Example.
gcc -o cm10_macroinit cm10_macroinit.c
cm10_macroinit > /dev/ttyS0
