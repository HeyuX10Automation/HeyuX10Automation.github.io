Here is a patch, if you are are interested, which allows extended dimming
control (for my Leviton light switches).  Its just a simple modification
of the preset.c code.  Its only been tested on one house code ('o') and
I'm not a C programmer so here's hoping it works!

Thanks for the software,

Aaron
