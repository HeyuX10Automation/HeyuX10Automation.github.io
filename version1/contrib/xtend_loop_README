If anyone is trying to use the patched copy of xtend-1.2beta4 on the
heyu web site, you've probably run into the cpu loop problem.  I used
to kill xtend every hour or two (via script).  I finally straced out
the problem.  The following patch applied to the util.c file (in the
patched copy of xtend-1.2beta4 at the heyu web site) has worked
flawlessly and run continuously for a couple of weeks without a single
cpu loop.
