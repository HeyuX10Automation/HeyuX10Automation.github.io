Subject: heyu and OpenBSD -- notes and FAQ

You see, I run OpenBSD systems, and though you appear to be aware 
that 'heyu' compiles and runs on OpenBSD boxes, I thought I'd let 
you know that it does indeed do so with a bit of elbow grease. So, 
these FAQ entries below, are geared towards getting 'heyu' compiled 
and running on such a system. It took me a while to figure some of 
this stuff out, especially how to setup the serial port tty (who 
really knows that a 'ttyflags' command exists? Hmmmm?), so I was
hoping that I could share these experiences -- really just an
enhancement to your existing FAQ questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. How do I get heyu configured for an OpenBSD system?

   Use the configuration script and configure for FreeBSD. It seems
   to be compatible:

   % ./Configure freebsd
   % make
   # make install

   There are a few minor warnings generated, but the result seems 
   to link and execute successfully, at least for heyu version 1.33
   and OpenBSD 3.2.


2. What tty should I use for an OpenBSD system?

   As with all OSes, this will depend on your configuration and
   kernel and which serial port you are using to communicate with
   the CM11A. By far the most common tty for use with a GENERIC (3.2)
   installation and a connection to the first serial port 
   is /dev/tty00.


3. I've set the tty device in ~/.x10config to /dev/tty00. I'm
   running OpenBSD, but 'heyu' complains about device permissions.
   How do I fix it?

   OpenBSD installs the serial tty devices with somewhat restricted
   file permissions:
   
   crw-rw----  1 uucp  dialer    8,   0 Jun  2 15:42 /dev/tty00

   It probably is a good idea from a security standpoint to run
   'heyu' under a non-root user. Either add the non-root user to
   the dialer group in /etc/group, or if you don't mind opening
   the device permissions:

   (as root)
   # chmod o+rw /dev/tty00

<and more information in addition to the existing FAQ (29)>

29) I use OpenBSD and don't see any information from the CM11.
    Running heyu info says Firmware revision Level = 0 and Interface clock not
    yet set.

    OpenBSD requires that you add the following to /etc/ttys:
    tty00   "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   unknown off local

    Note that it is necessary to include the 'local' keyword.

    You will need to reconfigure the port after making
    the change to /etc/ttys by running:

    (as root)
    # ttyflags tty00


------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope this can be used somehow to help other users. That 'ttyflags'
business is really what threw me, but the other questions did
come up, and while I can't say for sure that they will be applicable
to all OpenBSD installations, or even if 'heyu' will remain compatible
with OpenBSD, it certainly seemed to be a step in the right direction 
for my installation. If it helps, I'm running heyu version 1.33, as a
stable build under OpenBSD 3.2.

Best regards,
