# This file is used to tell HEYU where your CM11A is plugged in, what the
# default house code is, to set some variables and to define aliases for
# your X10 modules.  This file should reside in $HOME/.x10config
# See the man page x10config(5) for the file layout.
#
# this file should contain x10 appliance aliases, one per line, as:
#   appliance-name  housecode  modulenumber
# for example:
#  mydesklamp	A	4
#  atticfan	B	3
#
# In addition, the devicename for the line the Powerhouse is attached to must
# be specified.  An example is:
#  TTY	/dev/ttyS0
# and the default housecode with:
#  HOUSECODE	A
#
# Sample aliases
frontleft	A 1
frontright	A 2
backleft	A 3
backright	A 4
allwater	A 1-4
water		A 1-4
#
email_arrived	A 5
monitor		A 6
batteries	A 7
high_thermostat	A 8
#
# set default housecode -- the one the switches will use
HOUSECODE	A
#
# Set the port the program will use.
