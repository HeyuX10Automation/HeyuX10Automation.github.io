I present this free software for your use.  It will compile on many Unix
and Linux systems.  The full source is available here.  An executable copy of the program can be downloaded too.
You may use this software as your needs dictate, just don't sell it to
others or represent it as your own work.  If you want to use it as part
of a commercial distribution, contact me for permission.

I am your typical gadget freak.  I enjoy all sorts of gadgets, from
simple toys like the Etch-A-Sketch to complex things like my K6 (and Athlon) powered Linux
computers.
Any old gadget will do.  I drove an RX7 because it had the most unique
engine (a rotary, for those that don't know already).  Now I drive a 
Prius Hybrid gas/electric car.
</p>
<p>
One of the gadgets I like is the CM11A.  I created HEYU because there
was nothing available to control my CM11A from within Linux.  I prefer
not to use Windows when I can avoid it.  There are now several programs that
can communicate with the CM11A from linux.  See the links below.

HEYU software for CM11A Home Automation<br/>

</center>

<p>
The CM11A is a device
built by the <a href="http://www.x10.com/">X10 company</a>
for controlling devices by sending signals through the
power lines.  It's a small box that plugs into an AC outlet and connects to
a serial port.  The CM11A is shipped with a Windows application called "Activehome".
</p>
<p>
I have put together a Linux program that will operate the CM11A computer interface.
It will control your X10 devices, set the cm11a interface clock and
monitor x10 signals on the AC power lines.  It will upload macros and timers to your CM11A for stand-alone execution.  It is tailored to Linux, but
it should work with other unix systems.  The <a href="README.html">readme file</a> has a bit more information about the program.
I highly recommend reading the <a href="heyufaq.txt">FAQ</a> if you are at all interested in it.
</p>

<p>The program has been written per the protocol.txt documentation from 
<a href="http://www.x10-beta.com/ActiveHome/"> X10's beta web site</a>.
You may need to use <a href="ftp://ftp.x10.com/pub"> X10's ftp site</a> to get the docs.
I have updated that document with my own notes and discoveries.
A link to my updated version is below. 
It's also included in the sources tar file.
</p>


<p>Many people have had problems downloading the source file via Netscape.  
The easiest way is to right click, then choose 'Save this link as..."<br/>
<br/>
Current stable (and final version 1) release = <a href="x10_heyu.tgz">1.35_3</a>
<!-- Current beta 1.X version = <a href=beta>1.34beta7</a><br/> -->
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>There will be no more enhancements to Version 1. It is capped at heyu 1.35</b>.
Future enhancements for HEYU will be to Heyu Version 2, currently being maintained
by Charles Sullivan.  Heyu 2 uses a different
way of looking at the CM11 time (always on standard time) and will not try to
remain backwardly compatible in it's configuration file locations, output or command structure.
<b>Go to <a href=../>Heyu Version 2</a> pages</b>
</p>
<p>
Version 1.3X has a few changes from 1.29.  Most notable are the addition
of dusk and dawn timers (via the auxiliary program <i>makesched</i>),
a configure script and a install script that checks for permission
problems.  An overrun condition with the macros was also fixed.
The overrun sometimes caused extra macros to run after a macro
 was triggered.
<i> Version 1.35_3 has some installation script fixes</i>.
</p>
<p>
The 1.35 version supports multiple CM11s.  It has code to change the CM11
clock when the DST flag changes.  It does not eat up processor time when
the CM11 is disconnected.  The monitor output is a little easier to read
from a script.  It provides some of the functionality of <i>xtend</i>
by calling a configurable external helper program each time a powerline
event is detected.
</p>
<p>
  Note that allowing multiple CM11s required a change of the the spool file name, so xtend users will have to change their config files.
</p>
<p>
Please note that <b>xtend 1.1</b> does not work
with HEYU 1.28i1 or higher unless you apply the <a
href="beta/xtend-1.2beta4.patch">xtend patch</a> to against <a
href="ftp://ftp.jabberwocky.com/pub/xtend/">xtend-1.2beta4</a>.
I have  posted a <a href="beta/xtend-1.2beta4.local.tgz">patched copy of
xtend-1.2beta4</a> with permission from David Shaw.  Please read this
specialized <a href="xtend_faq.txt">xtend+heyu faq</a> if you have any
questions about using xtend with heyu.

There is a mailing list for Heyu users at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/heyu_users"> http://groups.yahoo.com/group/heyu_users.</a>  This is where I will be
announcing changes and upgrades.  It should also be a place for Heyu

<p>Do you prefer a graphical interface over a command line?  Look at <a href="http://www.houseofhack.com/tkx10/"> TKx10 </a> for a Perl/TK  implementation of a graphical front end by haig@houseofhack.com.  The perl package mentioned at his site is Tk800.022.tar.gz

Do you want to access your X10 via the web?  Bluelava does a nice job.  It's
a perl CGI script that works nicely.  The home page is at <a href="http://www.sgtwilko.f9.co.uk/bluelava/"> http://http://www.sgtwilko.f9.co.uk/bluelava/</a>

Another new web based control is DRACONi Automation.  It's designed to be 
a freeware (GPL) home automation and digital entertainment control package.

Do you want to trigger a program when HEYU reports a specific code?  Try David Shaw's Xtend software. It will respond to incomimg X10 signals by running any unix command you want.  It's at the <a href="http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/xtend/">Xtend Home page</a>.

Neil Cherry's <a href="http://www.linuxha.com/"> Linux Home Automation Page</a> has a
lot of links to many good home automation sites.  He also mirrors
a lot of the Linux software that's available.

Home-Automation.org is hoping to become the ultimate site for home automation.  Their URL is <a href="http://home-automation.org">http://home-automation.org</a>

<p>My program is based on the program called "x10" by
Larry Campbell as modified by Paul Fox for Linux.  His <a href="http://www.foxharp.boston.ma.us">home page</a> has a link to his program.

The original X10 program <a href="ftp://ftp.foxharp.boston.ma.us/pub/pgf/index-1.html#ss1.3">
(download  CP290 version from here)</a> only works with the cp290 interface.

Compatibility<br/>

The program will work with:
<ul>
<li>The CM11A and CM12A made by the X10 corporation.
The "Activehome" package (CK11) includes the CM11A.</li>
<li>The CM10 if you run the CM10 macro init program (from the <a href="contrib"> contribs directory</a>) after every power failure.</li>
<li>The Home Director package marketed by IBM.</li>
<li>The Home Control package marketed by Radio Shack (model 61-2417).</li>
<li>Options are included to compile on Linux, Solaris, SysV, Freebsd, OSF1 v4.0 and nextstep 3.3.  I'll be adding the changes for SCO and NetBSD soon.</li>
</ul>
It will not work with:
<ul>
<li> CK17  Firecracker (computer controlled RF transmitter)</li>
<li> CP290 (older style computer - X10 interface)</li>
<li> CP10 - A power strip with X10 built in ???</li>
<li> Extend 1.1 (look for newer than 1.2beta4)</li>
</ul>
