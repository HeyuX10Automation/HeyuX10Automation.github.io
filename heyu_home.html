<div id="main">
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h3>

<p><b>HEYU</b>
is a text-based console program for remotely controlling lights and appliances
in the home or office.&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete source is made available under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPLv3</a> license.
</p>

<p>Heyu uses the <b>CM11A</b> computer interface to send and receive X10 control signals over the
AC power lines to modules which can turn On, Off, or Dim attached lamps
or appliances.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can store a schedule of timed events in the CM11A memory for execution
when the computer is turned off or disconnected.</p>
<p>
Heyu supports an optional <b>W800RF32A</b>, <b>MR26A</b>, or <b>RFXCOM</b> RF receiver connected to a
second port as an auxiliary input device for RF signals from X10 and other supported transmitters.</p>
<p>
Heyu can also use an optional <b>CM17A</b> interface to transmit X10 RF signals.
</p>


<h3 style="text-align: left;">Features</h3>

<p>Highly configurable and able to transmit and receive any X10 signal
supported by the CM11A.
</p>

<p>Monitor and/or log all X10 signals on the power line.
</p>

<p>Maintain a record of the state (On, Off, Dim level) of modules
based on received or transmitted X10 signals.&nbsp;&nbsp; A variety
of different lamp and appliance module types are supported as well
as specialty modules like RCS-compatible thermostats and remote
thermometers, and shutter motor controllers.</p>
<p> 
Decoders are included for RF signals received by a W800RF32A or 
RFXCOM receiver from security remotes and sensors and from RFXSensor
Temperature, Humidity, and Barometric Pressure sensors, and with a RFXCOM
433.92 MHz receiver for RF signals from RFXMeter Power, Water, Gas, and Pulse
sensors, Digimax thermostat, KaKu remotes, and Oregon Scientific, Electrisave, and
Owl CM119 sensors.
</p>

<p>Execute scripts or commands based on received or transmitted X10
powerline or RF signals and the recorded states of modules.
</p>

<p>Upload schedules of timed events and macros to the CM11A memory
for operation without a computer.
</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>
    <p>Events may be scheduled for execution at local clock times
       or relative to the times of daily Dawn or Dusk.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schedules may be uploaded for the calendar year, or
       alternatively for a period beginning on the current date and
       extending a year into the future.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Event dates and times are automatically adjusted for Leap Years
       and periods of Standard and Daylight Time.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Control multiple CM11A interfaces connected to different serial ports
on the same computer.
</p>

<p>With an optional CM17A device, transmit X10 RF signals to a transceiver
for conversion to power line signals (possibly on a separate branch of the
AC line), or to an X10 RF receiver connected to a different computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any of the 64K different RF signals supported by the CM17A may be transmitted.
</p>


<div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"><b>Operating Systems</b>
</div>
<p>Heyu is developed and maintained under Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compile options for
Mac OS X (Darwin), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, SunOS/Solaris, SCO Unix, AIX, NextStep,
and OSF have been implemented with the aid of the Heyu User Community.
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"><b>Hardware</b>
</div>

<p>The <b>CM11A</b> is manufactured by <a href="http://www.x10.com">X-10 (USA) Inc</a>
and sold as such and as part of their CK11A ActiveHome kit.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also sold rebranded
as the IBM <b>HD11</b> Home Director and the RCA <b>HC60CRX</b> Home Control Interface.
It plugs into an AC socket and connects to the computer via an RS232 serial port.
&nbsp;&nbsp;(A USB-Serial adapter can be used for computers which don't have an RS232
port.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a clock with battery backup and a 1 KB non-volatile
memory for stored timers and macros.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compatible 230 Volt devices are
sold outside North America as various CM11x models; &nbsp; in the UK as the <b>CM12U</b>.  
</p>

<p>Heyu also supports the <b>CM10A</b>  (IBM <b>HD16</b>), an older device similar
to the CM11A but without clock or battery backup, and marketed as an early version
of the IBM Home Director.
</p>

<p>The <b>W800RF32A</b> RF receiver is manufactured by
<a href="http://www.wgldesigns.com">WGL &amp; Associates</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
device can receive X10 RF signals from standard, entertainment, and
security remotes and sensors.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the US/Canada version,
an international version, the <b>W800RF32AE</b>, is available which operates
at the X10 RF frequency used in Europe and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <b>RFXCOM</b> X10 RF receiver from <a href="http://www.rfxcom.com">RFXCOM</a> is
a USB device but incorporates an FTDI USB-Serial chipset and maps to a serial port.
&nbsp;&nbsp; It can receive X10 RF signals from standard, entertainment, and security remotes
and sensors, and is available in both 310 MHz US/Canada and 433.92 MHz International frequency
versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; The International version can also receive signals from
RFXMeter sensors, Digimax thermostats, and Oregon sensors.</p>

<p>The X-10 <b>MR26A</b> receiver can receive X10 RF signals from standard and some
entertainment remotes, but not security remotes or sensors.</p>

<p>For users in North America, Heyu optionally integrates support for
the X-10 <b>CM17A</b> "Firecracker", a small serial dongle which transmits X10 RF
signals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The CM11A and CM17A coexist on the same serial
port - no additional port is required.)
</p>

<p>Heyu does NOT support the X-10 CP290 interface, the Smarthome
PowerLinc 1132B interface, or any USB-only interface like the X-10 CM15A
"ActiveHome Pro".
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"><b>Support</b>
</div>

<p>Support for Heyu is provided via the
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/heyu_users">heyu_users forum</a>
at Yahoo groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;Heyu developers and members of the Heyu User Community
receive and respond to Heyu questions, bug reports, and feature
requests. &nbsp;&nbsp;New releases of Heyu will be announced there.
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"><b>Development</b>
</div>

<p>Current activities can be followed on the
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/heyu/">
Heyu project page</a> at BerliOS Developer site.
Some old development related information can still be found on
<a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/heyu">
Heyu development space</a> at Assembla site
before it is migrated to BerliOS.
